    He got a little mad, but I don''t care
    that much.

    He''s not to be worried about.'
  resultIncorrect: 'Jake (I think it was him) asked me for 20 dollars to buy vape.

    I
    sent him money.

    He blocked me,,,

    Should have seen it coming.

    Who
    needs 20 dollars for just a vape. I''m really naive.'

    Fortunately his friend
    Tom DMed me to apologise for Jake. Also he returned me money.
